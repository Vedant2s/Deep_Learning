The original purpose of VGG's research on the depth of convolutional networks is to understand how the depth of convolutional networks affects the accuracy and accuracy of large-scale image classification and recognition. -Deep-16 CNN), in order to deepen the number of network layers and to avoid too many parameters, a small 3x3 convolution kernel is used in all layers.\n"

A 3x3 or 1x1 filter is used, and the convolution step is fixed. . There are 3 VGG fully connected layers, which can vary from VGG11 to VGG19 according to the total number of convolutional layers + fully connected layers. The minimum VGG11 has 8 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The maximum VGG19 has 16 convolutional layers. +3 fully connected layers.
